Installation of theme on Drupal 6
------------------------

- Download Aether from http://github.com/krisbulman/aether (with --branch 6.x-1.x flag)
- Download ischolartheme from http://github.com/roblib/ischolartheme
- Unpack and place the ischolartheme folder in your Drupal installation under
  one of the following locations:

    * sites/all/themes
    * sites/default/themes
    * sites/example.com/themes

- Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to
  /Appearance (admin/appearance) and if you installed the theme
  properly you should see Aether and Ischolartheme.
- You do not need to enable Aether for this theme to work, it
  just needs to be in the same directory.
